Taking into account both national and regional languages, it is seen that Italian and Sardinian are together the least differentiated from Latin.[6] Italian is an official language in Italy, Switzerland (Ticino and the Grisons), San Marino, and Vatican City. It has an official minority status in western Istria (Croatia and Slovenia). </p>
