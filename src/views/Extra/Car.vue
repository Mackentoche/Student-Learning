But if you don't know how to clean an engine, here are two good reasons why you should do car engine cleaning. First, a clean engine is easier to work on.

      <div class="col-6"><h5> <a href="/Math"> How to  <span class="badge badge-secondary"><button> Jumpstart Car </button> </span> </a></h5>  <p>Car batteries have two larger nubs, called terminals. There is a positive terminal and a negative terminal. Each should be clearly marked. Connecting cables to the right terminal is important to completing the circuit and gives power to the dead battery.  </p> <video-embed css="embed-responsive-21by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjvZw9jZCaE"></video-embed></div>

Now withdraw it and look closely at the tip, which should have oil on it. If the level of the oil is between the two lines, your vehicle has enough oil.

      <div class="col-6"><h5> <a href="/Math"> How to  <span class="badge badge-secondary"><button> change Oil</button> </span> </a></h5>  <p>It used to be normal to change the oil every 3,000 miles, but with modern lubricants most engines today have recommended oil change intervals of 5,000 to 7,500 miles. Moreover, if your car's engine requires full-synthetic motor oil, it might go as far as 15,000 miles between services! </p> <video-embed css="embed-responsive-21by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnS53T3gcPg"></video-embed></div>
